\subsubsection{Pseudo Invariant Features}

This model employs pseudo-invariant feature (PIF) pixels extraction from the Landsat Climate Data Record (CDR) Surface Reflectance product along with an in-water radiative transfer model (HydroLight) to obtain the field spectra to be used in the ELM method. 
 A mask is created applying a threshold a the ratio between the NIR band and the red band. 
 A mask is created applying a threshold to the SWIR 2 band. 

The model based empirical line method (MBELM) atmospheric correction method is based in the well known empirical line method (ELM).
