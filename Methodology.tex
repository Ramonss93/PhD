\chapter{Methodology and Approach}
\label{ch:method}

The methodology is separated into the specific objectives mentioned in Section \ref{ch:objectives}. In this work, a look-up-table (LUT) methodology was implemented to retrieve concentration of water constituents using Landsat 8 imagery. Figure~\ref{fig:retrieval} shows a diagram of this retrieval process. First, the Landsat 8 image data (shown at the top of the figure) needs to be atmospherically corrected. Then, a non-linear optimization routine uses the water pixels (reflectance values) and a LUT of reflectance spectra to estimate concentrations for each water pixels in the scene. The outputs to the process are concentration maps for each water constituents, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:retrieval}. This process is explained in details in Subsections \ref{sec:atmcorr} and \ref{sec:retrieval} below.

\section{Atmospheric Correction} 
\label{sec:atmcorr}
The first objective in this research is to identify a suitable approach to atmospherically correct the type of dataset provided by the OLI sensor. This is a complex task to perform over water because the signal leaving the water that reaches the sensor is very small compared to the signal reaching the sensor from atmospheric scattering. Most of the atmospheric correction algorithms applied to ocean color satellites are not suitable for highly turbid coastal waters because the {\it black pixel assumption} cannot be applied to these types of waters~\cite{Patt2003}. Two methods are be investigated in this research.

\subsection{Model-based ELM}
The first method will be a model-based empirical line method (ELM) based on previous work done by \cite{Gerace:2013} and \cite{Gerace:2012}  for simulated OLI data. While this new method is based on the traditional ELM method (see Section \ref{subsec:ELM}), this model-based ELM method tries to avoid the measurement of ground truth at every sensor passover over the scene by using pseudo-invariant features (PIF) \index{pseudo-invariant features (PIF)} in the scene as one target along with a estimation of water reflectivity for an open lake region for the other target. The two targets used in this model-based ELM to solve the regression in \autoref{eq:ELM} are referred to in this documents as the {\it bright pixel} \index{bright pixel} and the {\it dark pixel}\index{dark pixel}.

This method employs a PIF pixel extraction \cite{Schott:1988} to mask urban landscape from both the reflectance product and the Landsat 8 image for the bright pixel determination. Pseudo-invariant targets are defined as targets whose reflectivity properties do not change rapidly between different times of collection. Examples of pseudo-invariant target are urban features in the scene.  The PIF extraction isolates the pseudoinvariant features from the digital imagery. In our case, the PIF are the man-made urban features in a scene. A flowchart of the process is shown in \autoref{fig:PIFflowchart}.

\end{figure}

The PIF extraction from digital imagery proceeds in the following fashion. An infrared-to-red ratio image is very effective in the classification of water, vegetation, and urban features. The vegetation in this ratio image will tend to have a high brightness when compared to the urban features and water brightness. This infrared-to-red ratio image can be derived from the quotient of the NIR band (band 4 for Landsat-5; band 5 for Landsat-8) and the red band (band 3 for Landsat-5,band 4 for Landsat-8), as seen in \autoref{fig:PIFflowchart}. This ratio image is thresholded from the high digital count values downward to create a mask so the high brightness pixels are eliminated (vegetation pixels) from the image, that is, these pixels are set to a value of zero and the rest (water and urban pixels) to a value of one. The SWIR 2 band (band 7 in Landsat-5 and Landsat-8) is used to eliminate the water pixels from the previous mask since water has nearly zero reflectance in this spectral region. This SWIR 2 band is thresholded from the low brightness values upward. Water pixels will exhibit a low value when compare to the rest of the pixels. A mask is created by assigning a value of zero to the low brightness pixels (water pixels) and a value of one to the rest (urban features and vegetation). Finally, the two mask created are combined using a logical .AND. resulting in a mask that will have a value of one only in the urban feature pixels, i.e. the PIFs, as shown in \autoref{fig:PIFflowchart}. This mask will be named PIF mask for the rest of this document. An example of a PIF mask is illustrated in \autoref{fig:PIFmask}. A false color image of the Downtown Rochester, NY is shown on the left (vegetation in red) and a RGB image of the same area with the PIF mask applied is shown on the right (urban features in bright color while masked pixels in black).

\end{figure}

The PIF mask is used to determine the bright pixel spectra in both radiance (from the Landsat 8 image) and reflectance values (from the Landsat Surface Reflectance CDR \cite{LandsatCDR} image). See Section~\ref{sec:CDR} for more details about the Landsat reflectance product. The Landsat reflectance product was available for a total of 9 Landsat 5 scenes where clear sky conditions were acceptable. One PIF mask for each of these 9 scenes was created using ENVI. In addition, one PIF mask was created from the Landsat 8 radiance image. Finally, these 10 PIF masks were combined to create a ``master'' PIF mask \index{master PIF mask}. Then, the statistics were calculated in ENVI for each scene using this master PIF mask. An example of the statistical results obtained from ENVI are shown in \autoref{fig:PIFstats}.(a) and \autoref{fig:PIFstats}.(b) for one scene of the Landsat reflectance product (in reflectance units) and for the Landsat 8 image (in radiance units), respectively. The mean value is shown in black solid line, the green solid lines are the mean plus standard deviation and the mean minus standard deviation, and the red solid lines are the maximum and minimum values for each band. The mean values for each one of the 9 scenes are shown in \autoref{fig:ZenithCorr}.

\end{figure}

As seen in \autoref{fig:ZenithCorr}, the PIF reflectance values for each scene are not the same, but a high correlation between the reflectance values and the solar zenith angle for each band was found. A linear relationship was determined for each band by applying a linear regression in MATLAB and the $R^2$ and root mean square error (RMSE) values were calculated as a way to measure this correlation. This linear relationship has the form 
\begin{equation}
	y = m*x + y_0
	\label{eq:linear}
\end{equation}
where $x$ represents the solar zenith angle and $m$ the reflectance value. \autoref{fig:Band1Corr} shows the reflectance values versus the solar zenith angle for band 1 for the 9 Landsat reflectance scenes and the calculated linear relationship. The values $m$ and $y_0$ found for all the bands are shown in \autoref{tab:ZenithCorr} along with the $R^2$ and RMSE values for each band. It can been seen in \autoref{tab:ZenithCorr} the $R^2$ values are bigger than $90\%$ for all bands, which suggests there are a high correlation between the reflectance values and the solar zenith angle. As a conclusion, these results show that the reflectance values remain constant over time and depend of the solar zenith angle of the sensor. 

The Landsat 8 image has associated a particular solar zenith angle. The previous linear relationships calculated will help to estimate the values for the reflectance value of the bright pixel for that particular solar zenith angle. For example, the solar zenith angle for the 09-19-13 Landsat 8 scene is equal to $45^\circ$, and therefore $x=45^\circ$ in \autoref{eq:linear}. The reflectance values for $x=45^\circ$ are shown in the last column of \autoref{tab:ZenithCorr} and plotted in \autoref{fig:ZenithCorr} in red asterisks.

Because the Landsat reflectance products was not available for Landsat 8 at the moment of writing this documents, it was necessary to estimate a theoretical reflectance value for the coastal band for Landsat 5 in order to match with the Landsat 8 bands. To accomplish this, it was assumed that the coastal band would exhibit a similar trend than the blue and green bands. Hence, a straight-line that passes over the blue and green band values was used to extrapolate the value of the coastal band, as seen in \autoref{fig:Extrapol}, where the estimation of this reflectance value for the coastal band is shown at $443 [nm]$ and the straight-line is shown as a black solid line. It is expected the Landsat reflectance product will be available for Landsat 8 in the future, so the previous step would not be necessary. Finally, the reflectance spectra for the bright pixel is shown in \autoref{tab:brightref}. As was mentioned previously, the radiance spectra for the bright pixel is obtained by applying the master PIF mask to the Landsat 8 image (see \autoref{fig:PIFstats}.(b)).

The reflectance spectra for the dark pixel is obtained from HydroLight. The inputs to HydroLight are taken from Conditions representative of the same ROI in the water present in the Landsat 8 scene are input to the model. Some conditions are the concentrations of water constituents, solar zenith angle, IOPs, backscatter phase function, for example. In order to have a reflectance spectra from HydroLight representative of the area of study, IOPs corresponding to the particular ROI need to be input into HydroLight. The measured IOPs and concentration measurements from ground truth collection are ideally used. Then, the reflectance spectra for the dark pixel from HydroLight is spectrally sampled to the Landsat 8 sensor response.

The radiance spectra for the dark pixel is obtained from a ROI in the water present in the Landsat 8 image that could be considered a dark region (i.e. open lake). Statistics are computed in this dark region, and the mean values in each band is used as radiance spectra for the dark pixel.

\missingfigure{figure showing and ROI in the Landsat 8 image and statistic in ENVI}

As a resume, \autoref{fig:ELMpxsENVI} shows the different spectra used to perform the model-based ELM, where four different spectra can be seen: one reflectance and one radiance spectra for the bright pixel (obtained using the PIF extraction over the Landsat reflectance product and Landsat 8 image, respectively), one reflectance spectra for the dark pixel (obtained from HydroLight), and one radiance spectra for bright pixel (obtained from the statistics of a ROI over water in the Landsat 8 image). These spectra are used to atmospherically correct the Landsat 8 image using the ENVI Classic software \cite{ENVIUserGuide}. This is performed using the ``Empirical Line'' algorithm of the ``Calibration Utilities'' in ENVI classic, where the Landsat 8 image is used as the input image, and the reflectance spectra are labeled as ``field spectra'' and the radiance spectra are labeled as ``data spectra.'' The product of this process is an image in reflectance values, which will be used to perform the retrieval of water constituents described in Section \ref{sec:retrieval} below.

Preliminary results of the model-based ELM atmospheric correction methods for an area of water in the Rochester, NY region are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:waterpxs}. This figure shows the spectrum of the water pixels after atmospheric correction (in reflectance values), and these exhibit shapes that correspond with the shapes of typical water pixels. Figure~\ref{fig:refcomp} shows water surface reflectance spectra as preliminary results from the model-based ELM method (solid lines) compared with results from a traditional ELM method (dashed lines) for four different regions of interest (ROIs) in the Rochester area (Cranberry Pond, Long Pond, and nearshore and offshore of the Lake Ontario). As can be seen, the atmospheric correction algorithm proposed exhibits less than one reflectance unit of difference in comparison to the results from the traditional ELM algorithm. While small, these differences have a significant impact on the retrieved water constituents. Therefore, the proposed atmospheric correction algorithm will be improved by this research. A further validation with ground-truth data is anticipated at the end of this research.

\subsection{Gordon's method for turbid water}
The second method will be an extension of a method developed for SeaWiFS over turbid coastal and inland waters \cite{Ruddick:2000bs}. This method is a modified version of the methods developed by Gordon \cite{Gordon:1997} for ocean color satellites, but when the signal leaving the water does contribute to the overall signal beyond the NIR part of the spectrum. By using longer wavelengths and restricting the input pixels to open waters, these methods can be  applied to many fresh and coastal regions. The water surface reflectance values obtained after atmospheric correction will be validated through comparison to water surface reflectance measured in situ.

\section{In-Water Constituent Retrieval Process}
\label{sec:retrieval}
\todo{Mention: water mask}The retrieval algorithm will be based on previous work done by Gerace {\it et al.} \cite{Gerace:2013} and Raqueno {\it et al.} \cite{Raqueno:2000}. The water surface reflectance product obtained after atmospheric correction from the previous stage is used as input to the retrieval algorithm. Each pixel in the reflectance product has an unknown concentration. A spectral matching technique is applied to predict this concentration by comparing the spectral shape of each pixel with the elements in a look-up table (LUT). The LUT is generated in HydroLight \cite{MobleyHE} for different triplets of water constituent concentrations. The spectral matching is made by a least square error minimization algorithm using the ``lsqnonlin'' package of the MATLAB's Optimization Toolbox. The output of this process is a concentration mapping for each water constituent that spans the range of constituents levels in the scene. An example of a LUT created in HydroLight is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:results1}. Preliminary results for concentration maps on a logarithmic scale over the area of study are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:results2} (Chlorophyll-{\it a} (CHL) in $[\mu g/L]$, SM in $[mg/L]$, and CDOM in $[1/m]$).

\section{Ground Truth Data Collection}
The area of study for this research is the Lake Ontario Rochester Embayment (latitude: 43°15'32.53"N and longitude: 77°36'13.10"W), which includes some nearby ponds (Long and Cranberry Ponds), the Genesee River plume, the Irondequoit Bay and the southern end of Lake Ontario, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:areaofstudy1} and Figure~\ref{fig:areaofstudy2}. This area was selected because it exhibits a wide range of variability in concentration of water constituents, so the retrieval algorithm can be tested with different scenarios. Landsat 8 images from this area of study and corresponding water samples collected at the time of the satellite's overpass will be used to test the retrieval algorithm. So far, there are only three satisfactory images available from the summer 2013. This project contemplates performing one new ground truth data collection during 2014. Therefore, images from the 2013-2014 spring and summer collection seasons will be used to test the methodology. Note that a difficult challenge of this research is to obtain images with relatively clear weather conditions (i.e. cloud free) over the area of study.

In order to have outputs in HydroLight that are representative of the water bodies that are being studied, inherent optical properties (IOPs) of those specific waters have to be defined as input to the HydroLight model. After collection, these water samples need to be analyzed in the lab to obtain IOPs for the main water constituents. Furthermore, apparent optical properties (AOPs) (i.e. water surface reflectance) and backscattering measurements will be also collected for further comparison and to pursue closure between the HydroLight AOPs results and in-situ AOPs measurements.

\section{Validation}
The results from the retrieval process will be validated by comparison with the concentration of water samples taken during field campaigns in the spring and summer of 2013, 2014 and 2015. These concentrations will be obtained from lab measurements made at the Rochester Institute of Technology. For further validation, the results will be compared with products derived from ocean color satellites such as MODIS (e.g. MODIS Chl-{\it a} product), in regions where it is possible.
