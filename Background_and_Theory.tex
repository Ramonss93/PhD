\subsection{Sensor-reaching Radiance}
\subsubsection{Reflective Paths}
\subsubsection{Governing Equation}

\subsection{Governing Equation}

From the total energy coming from the sun, only approximately 1390 $\left[\frac{W}{m^2}\right]$ reaches the Earth's atmosphere \cite{Schott}. This integrated value is known as the \emph{exoatmospheric irradiance}, or $E_S'$, and represents the total energy per unit area just outside the Earth's atmosphere due to the solar energy. Recall that \emph{irradiance} is the rate at which the radiant flux ($\Phi$) is delivered to a surface ($A$), defined as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:irradiance}
E = \frac{d\Phi}{dA}   \indent   \indent  \left[\frac{W}{m^2}\right]  
\end{equation} 

So, the $E_S'$ is calculated assuming that the flux $\Phi$ comes from a point source at the center of the sun such that it would produce an existence at the sun's surface, producing a flux at the mean Earth-sun distance of 1390 $\left[\frac{W}{m^2}\right]$ . For the present work, it is more convenient to express the irradiance spectrally, or other words as a function of wavelength, so we can describe the energy at desired wavelength, or spectral band.

The light source, usually the sun, interact with the target and then reach the sensor. This interaction will help us to extract about the target, in this case the water body. That is why in order to understand how the water quality parameter are retrieved, first it is necessary to introduce the concept of sensor reaching radiance. The sensor reaching radiance is defined as the accumulation of photons at the front of a sensor that one wishes to collect in an effort to obtain information about the target \cite{GeraceThesis} . The total sensor-reaching radiance is the sum of the radiances due to the individual solar and thermal paths.  \cite{Schott} shows that in the VNIR region (approximately 0.3-2.5 [$\mu m$]), the solar energy is so many orders of the magnitude higher than the self-emitted energy, so the thermal paths are negligible for this study. Also, we consider that radiance from the background is negligible because the water bodies are typically several kilometers wide. Assuming that the target is approximately Lambertian (radiance is equal in all directions), the total sensor-reaching radiance, $L$, is defined as \begin{equation} \label{eq:gov1} L(\lambda) = \frac{E'_S(\lambda)cos(\sigma')r(\lambda)\tau_1(\lambda)\tau_2(\lambda)}{\pi} +
                        \frac{E_{ds}(\lambda)r(\lambda)\tau_2(\lambda)}{\pi} + L_{us}(\lambda)
\end{equation} 
where:
\begin{tabbing}
\indent \indent \indent  $L(\lambda)$ \hspace{1mm}\=:  \indent \= total sensor-reaching radiance\\
\indent \indent \indent  $E'_S(\lambda)$\>: \>exoatmospheric spectral irradiance\\
\indent \indent \indent $\sigma'$\>:\>solar-zenith angle\\
\indent \indent \indent $r(\lambda)$\>:\>spectral reflectance target\\
\indent \indent \indent $\tau_1(\lambda)$\>:\>Sun-target path transmission of atmosphere\\
\indent \indent \indent $\tau_2(\lambda)$\>:\>target-sensor path transmission of atmosphere\\
\indent \indent \indent $E_{ds}(\lambda)$\>:\>solar downwelling irradiance\\
\indent \indent \indent $L_{u}(\lambda)$\>:\>solar upwelling irradiance\\
\end{tabbing}

Equation \eqref{eq:gov1} is the solar term of the "big equation" described by \cite{Schott}.

\subsubsection{Atmospheric Effect and Water} 
The goal of this section is to describe the different approaches used to atmospherically correct satellite imagery over water. First, we need to understand the effect of the atmosphere on the propagating energy. To do so, a description of the processes involved in the energy interaction in the atmosphere are described in the first part of this section. Later on, different techniques for atmospherically correcting satellite images are defined.

\subsubsection*{Energy Interaction in the Atmosphere }

The smallest non-molecular particles that are responsible for scattering are aerosols. Aerosol can be defined as dispersed systems of particles of small particles, liquid or solid, suspended in a gas, like atmospheric air. Therefore dust, haze, smoke, smog, fog, mist, and clouds can be considered to be specific aerosol types. The typical size and number density for non-molecular particles are shown in Table \ref{tab:aerosol_size}

Isotropic scattering at visible wavelengths occurs in nature in thick clouds or in fog. {\it Rayleigh scattering} \index{Rayleigh Scattering}  (a.k.a. molecular scattering) occurs where the wavelength of the radiation is much larger than the molecular diameters (e.g. daylight scattering or very pure water). On the other hand, {\it Mie scattering} occurs when the wavelength is of the same order of magnitude as the particle diameter. 

It is often convenient in visible ocean remote sensing to consider the atmosphere to be made up of two components: Rayleigh scattering of the air molecules and Mie scattering of haze and other aerosols. 

{\it Attenuation} is the lost of the radiation energy that combines scattering and absorption effects.

A plane wave traveling through a homogeneous material in the $z$ direction can be perceived as the time-averaged quantity irradiance \index{irradiance}  (power per unit area) on a surface \cite{Eismann2012}. The irradiance after propagation distance $z$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:BeerLaw}
  E(\lambda,z) = E(\lambda,0)e^{-\beta_a z}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_a$ is the absorption coefficient \index{absorption coefficient}  defined as
\begin{equation}
  \beta_a = \frac{4\pi \kappa}{\lambda}~~[m^{-1}],
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ is the imaginary part of the complex index of refraction and quantifies the absorptive characteristic of the medium. The absorption coefficient $\beta_a$ represents the fractional amount of flux lost to absorption per unit length of transit in a propagating beam \cite{Schott}. Equation \ref{eq:BeerLaw} is known as Beer's law \index{Beer's law} and tell us that the energy of light decreases exponentially with distance.

The {\it optical depth} \index{Optical depth, $\delta$}  $\delta$ (a.k.a. opacity) expresses the extent to which a given layer of material attenuates the intensity of the radiation passing through it \cite{Rees1990}. It is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \delta = \beta_{a}z
\end{equation}

\section{ Empirical Line Method}
\label{subsec:ELM}
The {\it empirical line method}\index{ELM} (ELM) is a method for calibration of image data to reflectance that uses ground truth.The ELM uses a linear regression in each band to relate digital counts or radiance to reflectance \cite{Schott}. The ground truth can be in general  either control panels or ad hoc control surfaces of known reflectance. These ground truth objects need to be approximately Lambertian to minimize any errors that could be introduced by sensor view angles effects. Also, this calibration targets are assumed flat and level, with no neighboring obscuration, and homogeneous as well. The ELM method generally assumes that the atmosphere is constant over the complete scene. If that is not the case, corrections must be made for changes in the atmosphere over the scene. The regression to be solved for each band in the ELM method is given by
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ELM} 
	L = m\times r_d + b
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the radiance reaching the sensor value, $m$ is the slope of the regression, $r_d$ is the reflectance of the target, and $b=L_u$ is the intercept, with $L_u$ the upwelled radiance or path radiance. Then, the reflectance of the any Lambertian objects can be calculated by rearranging \autoref{eq:ELM}. In order to solved this regression, i.e. determine the value of $m$ and $b$, we need to have at least two targets with known radiance $L$ and reflectance $r_d$. After $m$ and $b$ been determined, the reflectance of each pixel at each wavelength can be calculated from its radiance value from the image.

An ELM target needs to have a size at least three times the ground instantaneous field of view of the sensor that will image it at the time of data collection. Taking this in consideration, the target should be at least 90x90 meters big for the Landsat sensor, which is sometimes difficult to build or even to find in the scene.

\section{Landsat Surface Reflectance CDR}
\label{sec:CDR} 
The Landsat climate data record (CDR) surface reflectance product is part of the higher-level Landsat data product to support land surface change study developed by USGS \cite{LandsatCDR}. The surface reflectance CDR is generated from specialized software called Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) \cite{Masek:2006}. The LEDAPS software uses MODIS atmospheric correction routines to correct Level-1 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data. Atmospheric variables such as water vapor, ozone, aerosol optical thickness along with geometric variables ({\todo{What is geopotential height?} geopotential height} and digital elevation) are input with Landsat data to the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model. The 6S model outputs surface reflectance among others parameters. This surface reflectance product is called the Landsat surface reflectance CDR. This Landsat surface reflectance product has comparable uncertainty to the standard MODIS reflectance product \cite{Masek:2006}.

The LEDAPS algorithm works in the following fashion. First, calibrated images from the Landsat satellite are corrected to {\todo{What does TOA reflectance mean?} top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance} by correcting for solar zenith, Sun-Earth distance, TM or ETM+ bandpass, and solar irradiance. Then, the TOA reflectance is atmospherically corrected with the assumptions that the target is Lambertian and infinite, and the gaseous absorption and particle scattering in the atmosphere can be decoupled. The TOA reflectance can be expressed as \cite{Masek:2006}
\begin{equation}
	\rho_{TOA}=T_g(O_3,O_2,CO_2,NO_2,CH_4)\\	
		\times \left[\rho_{R+A}+T_{R+A}T_g(H_2O)\frac{\rho_s}{1-\rho_s\times S_{R+A}}\right]
		\label{eq:TOAref} 
\end{equation}
where $\rho_s$ is the surface reflectance, $T_g$ is the gaseous transmission due to the atmospheric gases, $T_{R+A}$ is Rayleigh and aerosol transmission, $\rho_{R+A}$ is the Rayleigh and aerosols atmospheric intrinsic reflectance, and $S_{R+A}$ is the Rayleigh and aerosols spherical albedo. The 6S radiative transfer code is utilized to compute the transmission, intrinsic reflectance, and spherical albedo terms. Ozone concentrations and column water vapor are derived from ancillary data. The aerosol optical thickness (AOP) is extracted directly from the imagery by using the dark, dense vegetation (DDV) method of Kaufman {\it et al.} \todo{add reference}.This method postulates a linear relation between SWIR surface reflectance and reflectance in the visible bands, based on the physical correlation between chlorophyll absorption and bound water absorption \todo{Research more about AOT and the Kaufman method!!!}. Finally, the derived AOT, ozone, atmospheric pressure, and water vapor are supplied to the 6S radiative transfer algorithm, which then inverts TOA reflectance to surface reflectance using \autoref{eq:TOAref}. 

According to the author in \cite{LandsatCDR}, the Landsat reflectance product has to be used with caution in coastal regions where land area is small relative to adjacent water because the efficacy of the surface correction is likely to be reduced. This product was available only for Landsat 4 TM, Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ At the time of this publication. An quality assurance (QA) layers is attached to this product and it can be used for pixel-level conditions and validity production. The surface reflectance products is available in the earthexplorer.com website in a HDF-EOS package that contains all necessary files and it can be read in ENVI (through an ENVI header file).

The HydroLight physical model has the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
	\item It is time-independent.
	\item Horizontally homogeneous IOPs and boundary conditions $\Rightarrow$ one spatial dimension (depth): no restriction on depth dependence of IOPs.
	\item Wavelength between 300 and 1000 nm.
	\item Finite or infinitely deep (non-Lambertian) water-column bottom.
	\item Arbitrary sky radiance onto sea surface.
	\item Cox-Munk air-water surface (parameterizes gravity and capillary waves via the wind speed)
	\item Various bottom boundary options.
	\item Includes all orders of multiple scattering.
	\item It can optionally include Raman scatter by water.
	\item It can optionally include fluorescence by Chl and CDOM.
	\item It can optionally include horizontally homogeneous internal sources such as bioluminescing layers.
	\item Polarization not included.
\end{itemize}
